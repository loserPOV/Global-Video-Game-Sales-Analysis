>**Objectives**: Data analysis and visualization project to analyze video games sales from 4 main
regions (NA, EU, JP, and Other), and also the cumulative Global Sales. Made a tableau visualization
dashboard to visualize the data for stakeholders to see.

>**Results**: 

    From all the visual and statistical analyses conducted, as a data analyst at Studio Game Game8, I can conclude several points that could serve as sales strategies for our next game. The points I've gathered are:

    1. Focusing on developing games in the "Action" genre can be a strategic choice, given that this genre has the highest total global sales. Additionally, consider other popular genres like "Shooter", "Sports", and "Role-Playing".

    2. Given the significant dominance of the North American region in total game sales and the Anova Testing showing a significant difference between regions, we should initially focus our sales efforts there. This is advantageous as the game will be in English, helping to reduce costs and development time by eliminating the need for localization and translation.

    3. We should also consider entering the global market to reach a broader audience. However, this will require significant time and resources.

    4. From our testing, we found no relationship between the publisher and sales. This leads to several strategic paths: we can partner with the best track record publishers, work with publishers we like, or collaborate with those offering the most favorable contracts.

    5. Game development should focus on platforms with the best sales percentages in the gaming market. We found that PS3 and X360 have similar percentages, making them the primary targets for our next game. However, we should also focus on PS4 and XOne as new generation platforms that have achieved significant sales.

    6. The conclusion is that by combining approaches that align with the above points, Studio Game Game8 can maximize the opportunity to increase sales by up to 25% for the next game. However, it's crucial to remain flexible and ready to adjust strategies based on market responses and current trends.
